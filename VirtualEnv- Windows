1. Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Pick version 3.6.X (replace x with the highest number displayed)
Be sure to check you're downloading the right python version for your system (64bit vs 32bit) Not sure?
Do a Cortana search for System Information, open it
look for System Type
mine says x64-based PC which means mine is 64-bit and I should download the Windows x86-64 executable installer
2. Open Python Installer (likely in Downloads):
Tick/Select Add Python 3.6 to PATH
Select Customize Installation (this is important)
Tick/Select pip (others, leave as default)
Hit next
Tick/Select:
Install for all users
Add Python to environment variables
Create shortcuts for installed applications
`Precomplie standard libary
Customize Install Location and use: `C:\Python36
Hit Install
3. Verify Python Installed in Powershell
Search/Open Windows Powershell
Type python -V and hit enter. Does the following show up?:
Python 3.6.2
If typing python -V fails, try:

Restart Computer
Uninstall python and redo step 2 above.
Verify pip by entering:

pip freeze
If you see The term 'pip' is not recognized as the name... then you do the installation correctly. Otherwise, you're good.
4. Update Powershell Settings:
You should only have to do this 1 time, if done correctly.

Search Windows Powershell (a search is important)
Right click, select "Run as Administrator"; cofirm security pop-up if needed
Enter:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
5. Create Dev Folder (directory):
Open Windows Powershell (not needed to run as Admin now)
Type:
C:\ > cd ~/
C:\ > mkdir Dev
6. Install Virtualenv:
Going forward, whenever you see > or $ before code, that means you should be working in the Windows Powershell (or Command Prompt if you don't have Windows Powershell)

To install a virtual environment:
 > pip install virtualenv
Verify:
> pip freeze
virtualenv==15.1.0
7. Create a Virtualenv:
Navigate to Dev:
 > cd ~/Dev
Make virtualenv parent directory:
 > mkdir cfehome
 > cd cfehome
Create virtualenv

 > virtualenv .
Note, if you have two versions of python installed you may have to do this:

 > virtualenv -p python3 .
Virtualenv shortcut to above steps:

 > cd ~/Dev
 > virtualenv yourenvname
 > cd yourenvname
Activate your environment:

 > cd \path\to\your\virtualen\env\ 
 > cd ~\Dev\cfehome
 > .\Scripts\activate
Nice work! Just verify:
 (cfehome) > pip freeze
the (cfehome) is the name of the virtualenv parent directory from above. When you see this, that means the virtualenv has been activated.
pip freeze should return nothing at this point
8. Reactivate and Deactivate Virtualenv
> cd ~\Dev\cfehome # or your virtualenv's path
> .\Scripts\activate
(cfehome) > deactivate
> .\Scripts\activate
(cfehome) >
9. Now install any Python Package:
> cd ~\Dev\cfehome
> .\Scripts\activate
(cfehome) > pip install django==1.11.5
*NOTE: django==1.11.5 is for version 1.11.5. If you need a different version, replace those numbers accordingly. Such as django==1.8.7 or django==1.10.7 or django==1.11.2. This is true for any python package.
